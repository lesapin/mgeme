	<p>The server is now running a plugin that removes dying player's projectiles. On many occasions, the "losing" side gets an unfair advantage in the next fight because their post-death rocket/pipe/whatever did damage, but not anymore. Although it's a minor new feature, I'm still interested in hearing any opinions people might have. You can visit AlliedMods for more information on the plugin itself at:</p><p><a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2814975&amp;postcount=1">https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=344992</a></p>

	<p>As this is the first news post, here is a great opportunity to talk about some of the inspirations behind MGE.ME the server!</p>
	<p>TF2 Classic has a small but dedicated community of players who want to play TF2 with improved performance, better developer support, fewer cheaters, and the new maps and weapons that hard-working modders have made. With the excitement around TF2C, some people might be open to trying MGE in a more casual environment, while others might have never heard of it before. MGE.ME is here to offer all TF2C fans an action-packed gamemode with the ultimate goal of kindling a deeper appreciation for the mechanical depth of Team Fortress 2.</p>

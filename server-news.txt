<p>As the first news post on this endeavour, here is a great opportunity to talk about some of the inspirations behind MGE.ME the server!</p>
<p>TF2 Classic has a small but dedicated community of players who want to play TF2 with improved performance, better developer support, fewer cheaters, and the new maps and weapons that hard-working modders have made. With the excitement around TF2C, some people might be open to trying MGE in a more casual environment, while others might have never heard of it before. MGE.ME is here to offer all TF2C fans an action-packed gamemode with the ultimate goal of kindling a deeper appreciation for the mechanical depth of Team Fortress 2.</p>
